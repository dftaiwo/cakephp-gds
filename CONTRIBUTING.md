# How to contribute

I welcome  contributions. There are several ways to help out:
* Create an [issue](https://github.com/dftaiwo/cakephp-gds/issues) on GitHub, if you have found a bug
* Write test cases for open bug issues
* Write patches for open bug/feature issues, preferably with test cases included

There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we have a
chance of keeping on top of things.

## Code of Conduct

Help us keep this open and inclusive. 
## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* Submit an [issue](https://github.com/dftaiwo/cakephp-gds/issues), assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
* Fork the repository on GitHub.
